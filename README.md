## Seconds it parses the 100+ logs

Any data needed in any database server can be effortlessly migrated with this fast algorithm. Just modify the code and run it. ðŸ¤©

For the multithreaded_main.py, it only takes 7.91 seconds to process all the logs, and that's very impressive to me.

In Windows, run the code with the:
```
python multithreaded_main.py
```

In Linux, run the code with the:
```
python3 multithreaded_main.py
```
